## What you'll learn ##

- Build a platform game with connected levels, pass through platforms, coins, enemiesâ€¦
- Design a title screen, pause menu, and score counter
- Learn some good Godot programming practices to keep your projects organized

## Prerequisites ##

- You will need some **basic understanding of GDScript**, which we cover in our [introduction to GDScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcdwP1Q2UlU). GDScript is the programming language you will use in Godot to code your games.

We also recommend reading the great [step-by-step guide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html) in the official Godot docs, if you haven't already.

## How to get this free course ##

The course will come out on our YouTube channel at the end of September. To get it, [subscribe to the GDQuest channel](https://youtube.com/c/gdquest) and click the notification bell to know when it is out.

We will also release a free introduction to steering behaviours soon, designed to be beginner-friendly as well!
